## Basics of Git

Push: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.

Pull: The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

Merge: The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

Rebase: Rebasing is changing the base of your branch from one commit to another making it appear as if you'd created your branch from a different commit.

cherry pick: git cherry-pick is a powerful command that enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD. Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. git cherry-pick can be useful for undoing changes.
